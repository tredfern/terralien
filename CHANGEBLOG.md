# Terralien Development

This file details the changes and experiences going through
developing this project. Frequently I lose track of what
I'm working on and where I am going. So hopefully by writing
notes I can detail what I've been learning and provide a point
to develop a more robust overview of this project in the future.

Here is where things ended up at the end of last night:

So what is going on that is interesting? Basically this is rendering out
a tilemap as a single batch where each tile can have it's own color. Not
the most exciting thing on the planet, but it allows for scaling this up
to have different kinds of terrain, and also we can start putting characters
into this pasturic paradise.

### Goals for next update
  * Show a character on the map
  * Character should be able to move about randomly
