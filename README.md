Terralien
=========

A prototype of a game that has been kicking around my head for many years. 
The goal is to create a real-time strategy game that is not focused on
maximizing the effectivness of your clicks but the ability to create and
adapt your strategy in a world where the resources and units are regularly 
changing.

Gameplay
--------

Most of this is very rough and scribbled on notes of paper but the following
are the critical points:

- You are the Intelligent Designer
- Your units are critters that can be mutated according to your direction. 
- Habitats will have some properties that effect the abilities of your critters while occupying them. 
- Your society will track two major resources: Food (gotta stay alive) and Mutagens (pressure to change)
- Being a god will also allow some abilities to effect the world. i.e. changing habitats' environment

How will evolution work?
------------------------

This is more vague right now. The main ideas will be there will be a way to evolve a new 'species'
(i.e. create a new unit) or enhance an existing one. The limiting factor will be that as you
choose a direction for your army of critters other routes will become more difficult to evolve
to. For example, if you adopt an exoskeleton strategy, options specific to endoskeletons will not
be available - unless of course, you take the time towards that direction, which will always be an
option. The idea is basically this is a highly variable technology tree but you don't get to just 
keep whatever mutation you evolved. If you evolve your critters away from something you can't just
flip back to what it was. Evolution works going forward, something extinct isn't going to help you
later.
