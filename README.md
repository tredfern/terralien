A variety of game ideas are in my head and this is a chance to try some things out.
For now, it's also a point to build out a framework for me to build some games on.


The Source
------------------

The application supports Python3 with the alpha branch of pyglet. 

//TODO: pip3 hg+pyglet something or other...

This also utilizes the pyeuclid library. I've updated that in this project to work with Python3 as well.
I'll probably push that up at some point in separate repo.
