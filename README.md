# Terralien

A variety of game ideas are in my head and this is a chance to try some things out.
For now, it's also a point to build out a framework for me to build some games on.


## The Source

The application supports Python3 with the alpha branch of pyglet.

  * Python 3.3
  * pygsty git branch
  * pyglet 1.2alpha alpha almost beta


Setting up requirements to run

    pip install -r Packages

For test suite and other development things

    pip install -r Development

This also utilizes the pyeuclid library. I've updated that in this project to work with Python3 as well.
I'll probably push that up at some point in separate repo.

## Development Status

## Thanks and Resources used

Not sure how many of these will be used in the final product (if there even ever is
a final product) but I found so many great resources while researching this project
that I'd like to thank those even if they don't get used in the end:

 * Python, particularly everyone that has ported to Python 3. Move Forward!
 * OpenGL
 * Pyglet, great library that saved me hours. Hopefully it can continue
 * DawnLike tileset. Thanks DawnBringer, and DragonDePlatino for creating it
 * game-icons.net Not sure which ones will be used yet, so thanks to everyone
     that contributes to that project:
