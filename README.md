=========

A prototype of a game that has been kicking around my head for many years. 
The goal is to create a real-time strategy game that is not focused on
maximizing the effectivness of your clicks but the ability to create and
adapt your strategy in a world where the resources and units are regularly 
changing.

The Source
------------------

The application supports Python3 with the alpha branch of pyglet. 

//TODO: pip3 hg+pyglet something or other...

This also utilizes the pyeuclid library. I've updated that in this project to work with Python3 as well.
I'll probably push that up at some point in separate repo.
