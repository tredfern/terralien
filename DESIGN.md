# Design Documentation

Always in flux, but ideas that come to me that I think are important or just
that I'd like to see I'll put somewhere in here for future reference. Especially
ideas that might be a ways off from completion.


## Interface

### Keyboard Controls

Watching some Dwarf Fortress videos for inspiration I touched on an idea that
keyboard controls are essential for complex games. Keyboard commands are scriptable
and easy to turn into macros that will behave in a predictable fashion where as
mouse commands have too many variables to really make sense in a variety of
scenarios. Now, I think the mouse is valuable for an interaction tool:
What is this? What can I do here? But for actually generating the keyboard might
be better. Also I have visions of allowing the keyboard to be scriptable and
customizable allowing users to generate sequences of keyboard commands to run.

That's way way down the line, but it's only possible if keyboard interaction is
the emphasis from the beginning.


## Game play

### Tropico meets Dwarf Fortress?
I don't know what kind of game play I'm going to end up with at this point. I
have always been drawn to games where characters are more or less autonomous but
you interact by giving jobs and commands on what needs to be done. I liked
Stronghold for it's focus on defending from increasingly difficult waves of attacks
but sometimes got frustrated with the amount of control units needed to not do
something stupid. But that fending for survival thing always makes me happy.
But I also liked the Tropico style industry building where you expand and get
more industry and resources and opportunities as time goes on, but it always
felt a little short on what I'd like in detail. I'll have to try DF some time
but I almost am afraid I'd try to rebuild it which is definitely what I do not
want to do. I want to create something my own, so taking more flawed (relatively)
games and focus on what I'd like seems like a good starting point to me.


## Dork stuff that interests me

### Procedural Generation

Really like the idea of playing around in here and making worlds that come to
life. It interests me more than games in general, so I will definitely be
focusing on this in stages as the game comes together. I like the idea of slowly
building on to it though and in a fashion where each step adds a little bit more
that is interesting.
